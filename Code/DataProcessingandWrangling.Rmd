## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#The data for nitrogen uptake was cleaned by renaming the column names to be better understood by the public. Multiple columns including columns for Blade Replicate, Day Replicate, Time, Season, and Nitrogen Type were changed to factors. Season and Nitrogen Type also had labels added to capitalize the names of seasons and nitrgoen types. 

```{r Data Cleaning for Nitrogen}

# Re-naming the column name
colnames(Nitrogen) <-c("Nitrogen_Types", "Season", "Day_Replicate", "Time","Blade_Replicate","Uptake_Rate","Biomass_Uptake","Nitrogen_Final_%","Nitrogen_Initial_%")

# Changing Blade replicate, Day replicate, time, seaon, and nitrgoen types to factors
Nitrogen$Blade_Replicate <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Blade_Replicate)
Nitrogen$Day_Replicate <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Day_Replicate)
Nitrogen$Time <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Time)
Nitrogen$Season <- factor(Nitrogen$Season, labels = c("Spring", "Summer"))
Nitrogen$Nitrogen_Types<-factor(Nitrogen$Nitrogen_Types, labels= c("Ammonium", "Nitrate", "Urea"))
```

#Data cleaning for the dtata for nitrogren data over years was cleaned y renaming column names as well. Date was changed from a factor to a date data type. Sites with missing values were also removed. 
```{r Data Cleaning for Nitrogen Years}

# Re-naming the column name
colnames(NitrogenYears) <-c("Sample_Number", "Year", "Month", "Date","Site","Number_of_Samples","Sample_Replicate","Wet_Weight","Dry_Weight", "Ratio_Dry_to_Wet", "Analytical_Dry_Weight", "Carbon_%", "Hydrogen_%", "Nitrogen_%", "Carbon_Nitrogen_Ratio", "Notes")

#Changing Date from factor to date
NitrogenYears$Date <- as.Date(NitrogenYears$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

#Removing sites with missing values
NitrogenYears <- subset(NitrogenYears, NitrogenYears$Sample_Number>0)

```


```{r Clean Data}

# Outputting the processed data
write.csv(Nitrogen, row.names=TRUE, file=here('Data', 'Processed', 'Nitrogen_Processed.csv'))

write.csv(NitrogenYears, row.names=TRUE, file=here('Data', 'Processed', 'NitrogenYears_Processed.csv'))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
