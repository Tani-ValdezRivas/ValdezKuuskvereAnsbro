## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Data Cleaning}

# Re-naming the column name
colnames(Nitrogen) <-c("Nitrogen_Types", "Season", "Day_Replicate", "Time","Blade_Replicate","Uptake_Rate","Biomass_Uptake","Nitrogen_Final_%","Nitrogen_Initial_%")

# Changing Blade replicate, Day replicate, and time to factors
Nitrogen$Blade_Replicate <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Blade_Replicate)
Nitrogen$Day_Replicate <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Day_Replicate)
Nitrogen$Time <- as.factor(Nitrogen$Time)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Summary}

# Outputting the processed data
write.csv(Nitrogen, row.names=TRUE, file=here('Data', 'Processed', 'Nitrogen_Processed.csv'))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
