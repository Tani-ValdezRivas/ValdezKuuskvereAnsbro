# Question 1: Does giant kelp nitrogen percent vary over year or season?

H0 : There is no significant difference of nitrogen percent over the past twenty years.
HA : There is significant difference of nitrogen percent over the past twenty years.

Prior to conducting this analysis, it was identified that nitrogen percent did not seem to visually change over the years. To get a better understanding..... 
```{r}
#1. LM for year
NitrogenRegressionYear <- lm(NitrogenYears$Nitrogen_Percent ~ NitrogenYears$Date)
#Linear regression on the nitrogen percent amount by year. P-value is less than .05. Which means there is significant difference. Residual standard error is small at .75 on 1280 degrees of freedom. However, year only explains 5% of nitrogen percent amount. 
summary(NitrogenRegressionYear)
#Correlation
cor.test(NitrogenYears$Nitrogen_Percent, NitrogenYears$Year)
#Running correlation test, the correlation score is -.202. So there is a negative correlation. So a somewhat weak correlation


#2. LM for Date
NitrogenRegressionDate <- lm(NitrogenYears$Nitrogen_Percent ~ NitrogenYears$Date)

#Linear regression on the nitrogen percent amount by year. P-value is less than .05. Which means there is significant difference. Residual standard error is small at .1648 on 728 degrees of freedom. Date explains 97.4% of nitrogen percent amount. 
summary(NitrogenRegressionDate)

#can't run corr because it is a date
#cor.test(NitrogenYears$Nitrogen_Percent, NitrogenYears$Date)

#3. Normal Distribution
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2))
plot(NitrogenRegressionDate)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

#Residuals v fitted, looking for symmetry. There is symmetry, and the line is fairly flat. There a re feww observations that are far off from the red line. Lowewr and higher ends do deviate from the Q-Q Residuals. Scale-location, there is very little symmetry with respects to the red line. Residuals vs Leverage, values outside dashed line show there are outliers.
